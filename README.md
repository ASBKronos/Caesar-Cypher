# Caesar-Cypher
Creating a python program for encryption and decryption of messages based on the Caesar Cypher 

Caesar Cipher is a way of encoding text that was seen as early as during the times of Julius Caesar.
So when he had top secret military messages, he would shift each letter of the alphabet by a certain
predetermined amount. So let's say we wanted to encode the letter E. We can line up the alphabet with a new set of alphabets
And at the moment,the shift is zero because the top alphabet and the bottom alphabet are lined up with a zero difference. 
Now, let's say that we had a shift of one. Then the alphabet moves to the left and A becomes B, B become C etc.

And we can keep going until we get to the amount of shift that we wanted.
